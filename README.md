## Application Development Mode Tool

This skeleton comes with [zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode). 
It provides a composer script to allow you to enable and disable development mode.

### To enable development mode

**Note:** Do NOT run development mode on your production server!

```bash
$ composer development-enable
```

**Note:** Enabling development mode will also clear your configuration cache, to 
allow safely updating dependencies and ensuring any new configuration is picked 
up by your application.

### To disable development mode

```bash
$ composer development-disable
```

### Development mode status

```bash
$ composer development-status
```

## Configuration caching

By default, the skeleton will create a configuration cache in
`data/config-cache.php`. When in development mode, the configuration cache is
disabled, and switching in and out of development mode will remove the
configuration cache.

You may need to clear the configuration cache in production when deploying if
you deploy to the same directory. You may do so using the following:

```bash
$ composer clear-config-cache
```

You may also change the location of the configuration cache itself by editing
the `config/config.php` file and changing the `config_cache_path` entry of the
local `$cacheConfig` variable.

## Skeleton Development

This section applies only if you cloned this repo with `git clone`, not when you
installed expressive with `composer create-project ...`.

If you want to run tests against the installer, you need to clone this repo and
setup all dependencies with composer.  Make sure you **prevent composer running
scripts** with `--no-scripts`, otherwise it will remove the installer and all
tests.

```bash
$ composer update --no-scripts
$ composer test
```

Please note that the installer tests remove installed config files and templates
before and after running the tests.
